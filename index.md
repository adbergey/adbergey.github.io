## Andrew Bergey

Hi! My name is Andrew Bergey and I am a 2nd year electrical engineering Ph.D. student at the University of Washington. I work with Professor Akshay Gadre in the Networking and Emerging Wireless Technologies (NEWT) Lab. The primary focus of my research is underwater acoustic metastructures for communication and sensing. Check out the latest projects happening in our lab [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fnewtlab.ece.uw.edu%2F&sa=D)!
